# Amazon-Vine-Analysis
Performing ETL and analyzing an Amazon luggage reviews dataset(https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Luggage_v1_00.tsv.gz). This was started by first creating seperate tables using queries in pgAdmin, importing the data into the tables, then sending it to the AWS RDS. I then used pandas to analyze the "vine_table".
