# Amazon-Vine-Analysis
Performing ETL and analyzing an Amazon luggage reviews dataset(https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Luggage_v1_00.tsv.gz). This was started by first creating seperate tables using queries in pgAdmin, importing the data into the tables, then sending it to the AWS RDS. I then used pandas to analyze the "vine_table".
**Results**
How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were 21 Vine reviews and 6309 non-Vine reviews.


How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 10 5 star Vine reviews and 3266 5 star non-Vine reviews.


What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
About 47.62% of Vine reviews were 5 stars and about 51.77% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.


**Summary**
A positivity bias is not present for reviews in the vine program. The percentage of 5 star reviews seems to be extremely close between Vine and non-Vine reviews(47% and 51%, respectively).
